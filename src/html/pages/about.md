  The gulp-metalsmith-starter's default theme is Lanyon, originally developed as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo), that I ported over for use with [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io).
</p>

It comes with many great features, including:

- Mobile friendly design and development
- Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
- Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
- [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

Find out more about Lanyon by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.
